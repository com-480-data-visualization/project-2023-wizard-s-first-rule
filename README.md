*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

We chose the dataset ["Video Game Sales with Ratings"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings). This Kaggle dataset, contains information about video game sales, ratings, and other relevant details. It aims to provide insights into the video game industry's trends and patterns, as well as the factors that influence a game's success in terms of sales and reception.

The dataset consists of several attributes for each video game, including:
- Name: The title of the video game.
- Platform: The gaming console or system on which the game is available.
- Year_of_Release: The year in which the game was released.
- Genre: The game's genre (e.g., Action, Adventure, Sports, etc.).
- Publisher: The company that published the game.
- NA_Sales: Sales in North America (in millions of units).
- EU_Sales: Sales in Europe (in millions of units).
- JP_Sales: Sales in Japan (in millions of units).
- Other_Sales: Sales in other regions (in millions of units).
- Global_Sales: Total worldwide sales (in millions of units).
- Critic_Score: Aggregate score compiled from various critic reviews (range: 0-100).
- Critic_Count: The number of critics who contributed to the critic score.
- User_Score: Aggregate score compiled from user reviews (range: 0-10).
- User_Count: The number of users who contributed to the user score.
- Developer: The company or team responsible for developing the game.
- Rating: The game's rating according to the Entertainment Software Rating



### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
